# Pokémon Trading App

## Description

This is the repository for the Database (Base de Dados) course project. The project consists of a Pokémon application that allows users to collect Pokémon cards and trade them with each other. The application's goal is to encourage the collection of rare cards and interaction between users through trading.

## Team

**Group P7G5**

- **Michael Cerqueira** - MEC: 108732
- **Simão Ildefonso** - MEC: 107997

## Features

- User registration, login and delete
- Adding and removing cards to/from the user's personal collection
- Viewing other users available for trading and their cards
- Proposing, accepting, and rejecting card trades between users

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The application is fast and responsive, even with a large amount of data (cards and users).
- Scalable to handle an increase in the number of users and cards without compromising performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main sections, including:

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Representation of the entities and their relationships within the system.
- **Relational Schema (ER):** Logical model of the database.
- **SQL DDL:** Definition of table structures in the database.
- **SQL DML:** Commands for data manipulation.
- **Normalization:** Steps taken to avoid data duplication and optimize space.
- **Indexes:** Creation of indexes to optimize query performance.

## Normalization

The database was normalized to the **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** to minimize data duplication and ensure referential integrity. With normalization, we achieved:

- Reduction of data redundancy.
- Improved performance for insert, update, and delete operations.
- Logical structuring of data, making system maintenance and expansion easier.

## Final Result

The application was successfully developed and evaluated, receiving a final grade of 16/20. This project demonstrates the practical application of database concepts, including normalization, relational design, and query optimization.
